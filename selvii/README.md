### Project Overview

 this project is done by using basic python operations.the resultant program of this project helps to maintain student management system.in this project,we will be using mathematical opertaions,list operations,string  operations like indexing and formating and dictionary operations.


### Learnings from the project

 after completing this project ,i come to understand about mathematical operations,list operations,string operations and also about dictionary operations.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 first,two lists are created and they are concatenated.if any names should be added ,they are appended.if any names should be deleted,they are removed from that list.dictionaries are created that reveals  each subject marks of a student and the total marks of that student is calculated which then gives the percentage  of that student .also a dictionary that gives marks of many students is given.then, the student who has scored maximum mark is found out and then it is given in the end of the program.


### Challenges faced

 i have just faced some indentation errors and after some clear gone through , i have cleared it all.
